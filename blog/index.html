        <h2>Launch Day: Why I Started AstroGear Labs</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

        <!-- YOUR POLISHED BLOG POST -->
        <p>I started AstroGear Labs because I’ve spent my entire life wanting to create robots. Technology inspired me when I was younger, especially seeing all the sci-fi robots on screen. Imagine a world where robots interact with us on a daily basis. Today, that idea is real — robots exist in all walks of life.</p>

        <p>But I didn’t want to create robots for a billionaire’s playground. I wanted to build robots that make the world better. Not in the “world peace” sense — we all want that, but I’m afraid that’s still a fantasy. What I mean is robots that can save lives, help people, and work beside humans in a way that truly matters.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’ve seen <em>Terminator</em>, and I know all about the Three Laws of Robotics. But that’s still science fiction. And even though we call today’s systems “AI,” the truth is that real artificial intelligence — the kind that could become Skynet — is still far in the future.</p>

        <p>I don’t know exactly where AstroGear Labs will go, but I do know it’s a place where my passion can keep growing. While robots are my main excitement, I’m also drawn to technology and innovative ways to improve daily life. Sure, phones may have pushed people backward socially, but not all technology is bad. And there will always be people who say we’re “defying God.” But are we? What if God <em>wants</em> us to grow, evolve, and use our minds to sustain our race?</p>

        <p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But if you want to follow a <strong>real</strong> journey in robotics — with successes, failures, experiments, and lessons — then stick around for more.</p>

        <p>The next topic will be Alfred 1: my attempt at a mobile robot that can navigate its environment while I learn ROS 2 and everything else that comes with it.</p>

        <p><strong>May you find what fuels you for tomorrow.</strong><br>– ERT</p>

    <h2>The Origin of Alfred 1</h2>
    <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

    <p>I started Alfred 1 with the idea of creating a robot that could mimic real-world problems—something small enough for one person to build, but complex enough to learn robotics properly. The name “Alfred” comes from the butler from Batman, and the “1” represents the first prototype in what I hope becomes a long series.</p>

    <p>Alfred 5 was actually the first robot I envisioned—a full-scale robotic butler inspired by Johnny 5, with a minion-like body wearing a butler suit and speaking in the voice of Lurch from <em>The Addams Family</em>. But building that version as my first robot would’ve been overwhelming for a one-man team working full-time, remodeling a house, and juggling a dozen other engineering projects.</p>

    <p>So I did what any engineer does: start at the beginning. I already had the Raspberry Pi 5, the SSD, the lidar, and other components purchased for Alfred 5. So I repurposed them into Alfred 1—a more manageable prototype meant to teach me ROS 2, Linux robotics, hardware integration, and real-world navigation.</p>

    <p>I installed Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS 2 Jazzy on the Pi. ROS 2 was the entire point of Alfred 1, so even when cameras and OS versions fought me, I stuck with it. I went from ArduCam to USB cameras and rewired half the lab in the process—but each failure made the design better.</p>

    <p>The whole project looks chaotic on the workbench, but in my mind it’s systematic and beautiful. The next post will dive into the bill of materials and the vision behind each choice. If you haven’t fallen asleep yet—stick around. This journey is only getting started.</p>

    <p><strong>ERT</strong></p>
