        <h2>Launch Day: Why I Started AstroGear Labs</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

        <!-- YOUR POLISHED BLOG POST -->
        <p>I started AstroGear Labs because I’ve spent my entire life wanting to create robots. Technology inspired me when I was younger, especially seeing all the sci-fi robots on screen. Imagine a world where robots interact with us on a daily basis. Today, that idea is real — robots exist in all walks of life.</p>

        <p>But I didn’t want to create robots for a billionaire’s playground. I wanted to build robots that make the world better. Not in the “world peace” sense — we all want that, but I’m afraid that’s still a fantasy. What I mean is robots that can save lives, help people, and work beside humans in a way that truly matters.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’ve seen <em>Terminator</em>, and I know all about the Three Laws of Robotics. But that’s still science fiction. And even though we call today’s systems “AI,” the truth is that real artificial intelligence — the kind that could become Skynet — is still far in the future.</p>

        <p>I don’t know exactly where AstroGear Labs will go, but I do know it’s a place where my passion can keep growing. While robots are my main excitement, I’m also drawn to technology and innovative ways to improve daily life. Sure, phones may have pushed people backward socially, but not all technology is bad. And there will always be people who say we’re “defying God.” But are we? What if God <em>wants</em> us to grow, evolve, and use our minds to sustain our race?</p>

        <p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But if you want to follow a <strong>real</strong> journey in robotics — with successes, failures, experiments, and lessons — then stick around for more.</p>

        <p>The next topic will be Alfred 1: my attempt at a mobile robot that can navigate its environment while I learn ROS 2 and everything else that comes with it.</p>

        <p><strong>May you find what fuels you for tomorrow.</strong><br>– ERT</p>
