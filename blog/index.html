        <h2>Launch Day: Why I Started AstroGear Labs</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

        <!-- YOUR BLOG INSERTED EXACTLY AS YOU WROTE IT -->
        <h2>Origin Story: Why I Started AstroGear Labs</h2>
        <p><em>By Eric Thomas (ERT)</em></p>

        <p><strong>AstroGear Labs was never just a project—it was the moment a lifetime of quiet sparks finally connected into something real.</strong></p>

        <p>When I was a kid, robots were the magic that made the world feel bigger than the small town I grew up in. I wasn’t just watching machines—I was imagining myself inside them, trying to understand how they moved, why they worked, and what it meant that something built by human hands could come alive with purpose.</p>

        <p>Sci-fi didn’t make me hopelessly dream of worlds we can’t have—it made me believe in the ones we <em>can</em>. Robots helping people, exploring the unknown, pushing the limits of what we believe possible. Not to build toys for billionaires. Not to replace people. But to serve, protect, and expand human capability.</p>

        <h3>The Framework Behind the Dream</h3>
        <p>If you’ve ever built robots, you know the rulebook—even the fictional one. Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws shaped how generations think about robotics ethics:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
            <li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
            <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Those laws aren’t real engineering specs, but they’re a reminder: The power of robotics should make the world better—not worse.</p>

        <h3>Why AstroGear Labs Exists</h3>
        <p>I didn’t create AstroGear Labs to chase fame or fortune. I created it to build things that matter. Robots that explore. Robots that help. Robots that make life just a little easier or safer. Robots that don’t fear or replace humanity—they uplift it.</p>

        <p>The truth is… I don’t know where AstroGear Labs will go. But I know the journey is real, grounded, and finally moving. And if you stick around, you’ll see robots succeed, fail, break, grow, and evolve—right alongside me.</p>

        <p>The next entry will be about Alfred 1, my first real step into ROS 2 navigation, mobile robotics, and a future full of possibilities.</p>

        <p><strong>May you find what fuels you for tomorrow.</strong><br>– ERT</p>
